# WTA_FireP
Revit addin, custom ribbon Tab with discipline related tools. Included is the 3dAimer example
that "aims" a special Revit family to a target. The enclosed Revit project is for demonstrating
the 3daimer.

Used by the tools in this ribbon are classes intended to provide a Revit family instance placement
without the Revit use interface overhead normally required by Revit. The custom tab employs menu
methods not typically seen.
